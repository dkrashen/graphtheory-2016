As I mentioned on Tuesday in lecture, there was no class today, and the homework will be turned in this coming Tuesday (April 5).

Expect a new assignment to appear within the next 24 hours online (which will be due Thursday, April 7), and I'll also be posting a video lecture to make up for the missed class time.

See you Tuesday!
