The homeworks are back and ready to be picked up. Since I'm out of town this week, I've put [Ernest Guico](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~guico/) in charge of them. He will be in his office this evening from 5:30pm to around 7:30pm, tomorrow evening at the same time for students to pick up their recent assignments. His office is in Boyd Graduate Studies Building, room 427G.

Best of luck on the final this Thursday!
