It just came to my attention that somehow the lecture notes from lecture 2 hadn't been posted (I had forgot to push the final button). They are up and available (<a href="http://dkrashen.github.io/graphtheory/lectures/lecture2.pdf">here, for example</a>), and hopefully the process will smooth itself out as we go!
