Tomorrow we will have a guest lecture by [Juan Gutierrez](http://euler.math.uga.edu/lab/html/index_en.html), during the class period, which I think will be very useful for getting some additional perspectives on some kinds of graph theoretic questions which people are interested in. I'm sure it will be a great talk.

On Tuesday next week, we'll be back on track with a discussion of walks, paths, trails, circuits, cycles,  and ideas of connectivity. You can get a sneak peak on some of these ideas already in the [notes](https://github.com/dkrashen/graphtheory-notes/raw/master/graphtheory.pdf).
