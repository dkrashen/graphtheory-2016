Just to make sure there is no last minute confusion, the information for the final exam is as follows. The final exam will be held this Thursday, May 5, from 12:00pm to 3:00pm in Boyd Graduate Studies Building, room 302. It will be proctored by Patrick McFaddin, since I am out of town this week.

If you have a grade of at least an A- in the course at this point (you can check on elc), then you are not required to take the final exam.
