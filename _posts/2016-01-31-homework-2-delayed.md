It seems that I forgot to post the second homework assignment last Thursday as I had planned to. I have put the second assignment online, and have decided to do as we did last week: the homework will be due a week later than originally stated: Thursday, February 11th (not the 4th). On the other hand, I may decide to add a few problems later this coming week. If I do so, I will be sure to notify the class in a website post, like this one.
