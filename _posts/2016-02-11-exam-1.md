As I mentioned in class, we will be having our first midterm towards the end of the month. Looking more closely at the calendar, I have decided to make it on Thursday instead of Tuesday, February 25th.

I'll be posting a practice/review sheet Thursday February 18, which will contain problems along the lines of the exam, and we will take Tuesday the 23rd to go over it.
