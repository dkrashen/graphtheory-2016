As I mentioned in class today, there will be no class this coming Tuesday (April 12), and our second in class exam will be on Thursday, April 21. I'll talk more about that exam in class next Thursday (the 14th). Roughly speaking though, the test will primarily focus on material we have covered since the first exam, such as colorings, matchings, Eulerian circuits and Hamiltonian cycles, flows and cuts.
