### Approximate course grades

If you go on elc, you should now be able to see a new grade item, which is your "appoximate final grade," calculated based on the first 2 exams and the homework which has been graded so far. This score is given on a 4 point scale:

3.5 and up = A
2.5 to 3.5 = B
1.5 to 2.5 = C
0.5 to 1.5 = D

If your approximate class grade is at least a 3.5, you do not need to take the final exam. Note that a grade of 3.7 and higher is an A while between 3.5 and 3.7 is an A- (and similarly for the other grade ranges).

### Final information

The final exam is a cumulative test, and your best way to prepare will be to review the previous exams, study sheets and homeworks. You will have 3 hours for the exam, but I will try to design the test to be completable within 2 hours.

### Choosing not to take the final

If you have an approximate class grade of at least 3.5, you can choose not to take the final. Some useful points:

 - if your grade is lower than a 3.5, you must take the final exam!
 - if your grade is at least a 3.5, you can choose not to take the exam at any time. you can even go to the exam and not hand it in!
 - if your grade is at least a 3.5 and you choose not to take the exam, any homework scores which have not yet been graded will not be counted against your score (but can still help your score). that is to say, you are guaranteed that your final class grade will be at least as high as your approximate grade.
